/*
  groups have a binding (A, B, L, R) and a length (number of tokens)
  not commutative
  is it associative? we hope so, so that we can use a fold

  A + L => A
  A + R => A, R
  A + A => A, A
  A + B => R

  L + L => L
  L + R => L, R
  L + A => L, A
  L + B => B

  R + L => A
  R + A => A
  R + B => R
  R + R => R

  B + L => L
  B + R => B
  B + B => B
  B + A => L
