        <h1>CollateX Reptilian Documentation: XML and JSON Manifest</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>Information about the witness data to be collated must be supplied to CollateX
                Reptilian with the help of a <em>manifest</em>, which is a JSON or XML document that
                either supplies the witness data directly (JSON manifest) or contains pointers to
                where it can be found on the local file system or at a remote location (XML
                manifest). This page documents the structure of both types of manifest.</p>
            <p><em>Breaking change:</em> Earlier releases of CollateX (Java and Python) allowed file
                paths for individual witnesses to be specified on the command line. This method of
                specifying file paths is not supported in CollateX Reptilian; users who wish to use
                file paths should instead incorporate them into an XML manifest.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>XML manifest</h2>
            <p>The following is a sample minimal XML manifest:</p>
            <pre><![CDATA[<witnesses xmlns="http://interedition.eu/collatex/ns/1.0">
  <witness siglum="A" url="localA.txt"/>
  <witness siglum="B" url="localB.txt"/>
  <witness siglum="C" url="localC.txt"/>
</witnesses>]]></pre>
            <p>The required components of an XML manifest are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>All elements in an XML manifest must be in the
                        <code>http://interedition.eu/collatex/ns/1.0</code> namespace. This
                        requirement can be met, as above, by specifying a default namespace on the
                        root element.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>The root element of an XML manifest must be
                        <code><![CDATA[<witnesses>]]></code> and it must contain two or more child
                        elements of type <code><![CDATA[<witness>]]></code>.</p></li>
                <li><p>A <code><![CDATA[<witness>]]></code> element must contain a
                        <code>@siglum</code> attribute and a <code>@url</code> attribute. The value
                        of the <code>@siglum</code> attribute will be used to represent the witness
                        siglum (identifier) in human-readable output. The value of the
                        <code>@url</code> attribute must be 1) a relative path to a file on the
                        local file system (relative to the location of the manifest file), 2) an
                        absolute path to a file on the local file system, or 3) a remote URL that
                        begins with <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code>. In the example
                        above, the <code>@url</code> values are all relative local paths.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The order of witness information in the output formats will conform to the order of
                the <code><![CDATA[<witness>]]></code> elements in the manifest, and what this means
                is different for different formats. For example, it is absolute for table formats,
                it applies within and between agreement groups for the alignment ribbon and TEI XML
                parallel segmentation, and it applies to sigla within individual edge labels in
                graph output.
                <!-- A future release will provide the option of choosing between manifest order
                and an order computed on the basis of witness similarity. --></p>
            <p>An XML manifest supports two optional attributes, as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>A <code>@font</code> attribute may be specified on
                        <code><![CDATA[<witnesses>]]></code> and <code><![CDATA[<witness>]]></code>
                        elements. A font specified on a <code><![CDATA[<witness>]]></code> element
                        will be used to render the text of that witness in output formats that
                        support font specifications (all HTML and SVG formats). A font specified on
                        a <code><![CDATA[<witnesses>]]></code> element will be used for <em>all</em>
                        witnesses, except that a <code>@font</code> value on a
                        <code><![CDATA[<witness>]]></code> element overrides a global font
                        value.</p>
                    <p>Font specifications are supported primarily because some writing systems are
                        inadequately represented by system fonts, and users may need to specify a
                        font that provides appropriate coverage. If no font is specified for a
                        witness on either the <code><![CDATA[<witness>]]></code> or
                        <code><![CDATA[<witnesses>]]></code> element, output will use whatever
                        default font the browser selects. Font information can be specified on a per
                        witness basis because collations of different writing systems (e.g., Old
                        Church Slavonic and Greek) may require different fonts in order to support
                        the character sets adequately. CollateX Reptilian does not attempt to
                        validate whether a specified font is available on your system; if it is not,
                        your browser will fall back on its own default font, with unpredictable
                        results.</p></li>
                <li><p>A <code>@color</code> attribute may be specified on either all
                        <code><![CDATA[<witness>]]></code> elements or no
                        <code><![CDATA[<witness>]]></code> elements. It is an error to supply a
                        color specification for some but not all witnesses. Color is used to render
                        witness-specific background colors behind the text of individual witnesses
                        in the alignment-ribbon output format; it is ignored elsewhere, including in
                        other HTML or SVG output. User-specified color values will be used directly
                        to style the output in CSS, which means that they can be expressed using any
                        color notation that CSS understands. CollateX Reptilian does not attempt to
                        validate whether a user-specified color value is meaningful; if it is not,
                        the fallback behavior is browser specific and therefore unpredictable. If
                        the user does not specify color values, CollateX Reptilian will use a
                        built-in default palette.</p>
                    <p>User-specified colors are supported because it is not realistic to anticipate
                        default colors that will meet the requirements of all projects by all users.
                        For example, the choice of colors may depend on the number of witnesses, and
                        also on whether the user wishes to use colors in the same range (e.g.,
                        different shades of the same basic color) to express relationships. Color
                        must be specified for all witnesses or for no witnesses because it is not
                        realistic to expect a combination of some user-specified colors and some
                        default ones to harmonize adequately. Unlike with the <code>@font</code>
                        attribute, there is no global <code>@color</code> attribute because the
                        point of color coding in the alignment-ribbon output format is to assist the
                        reader in distinguishing the witnesses from one another.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Below is a sample XML manifest that specifies font and color information:</p>
            <pre><![CDATA[<witnesses xmlns="http://interedition.eu/collatex/ns/1.0" font="GlobalFont">
  <witness siglum="A" url="localA.txt" color="red"/>
  <witness siglum="B" url="localB.txt" font="WitnessBFont" color="blue"/>
  <witness siglum="C" url="localC.txt" color="green"/>
</witnesses>]]></pre>
            <p>In the example above, witnesses A and C will be rendered using the global font and
                witness B will be rendered using the witness-B font.</p>
