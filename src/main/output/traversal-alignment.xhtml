 Habit  also  has  a  decided  influence ,  as  in  the  period  of  flowering  with  plants  when  transported  from  one  climate  to  another .  In  animals  it  has  a  more  marked  effect ;  for  instance ,  I  find  in  the  domestic  duck  that  the  bones  of  the  wing  weigh  less  and  the  bones  of  the  leg  more ,  in  proportion  to  the  whole  skeleton ,  than  do  the  same  bones  in  the  wild - duck ;  and  I  presume  that  this  change  may  be  safely  attributed  to  the  domestic  duck  flying  much  less ,  and  walking  more ,  than  its  wild  parent .  The  great  and  inherited  development  of  the  udders  in  cows  and  goats  in  countries  where  they  are  habitually  milked ,  in  comparison  with  the  state  of  these  organs  in  other  countries ,  is  another  instance  of  the  effect  of  use .  Not  a  single  domestic  animal  can  be  named  which  has  not  in  some  country  drooping  ears ;  and  the  view  suggested  by  some  authors ,  that  the  drooping  is  due  to  the  disuse  of  the  muscles  of  the  ear ,  from  the  animals  not  being  much  alarmed  by  danger ,  seems  probable .

 There  are  many  laws  regulating  variation ,  some  few  of  which  can  be  dimly  seen ,  and  will  be  hereafter  briefly  mentioned .  I  will  here  only  allude  to  what  may  be  called  correlation  of  growth .  Any  change  in  the  embryo  or  larva  will  almost  certainly  entail  changes  in  the  mature  animal .  In  monstrosities ,  the  correlations  between  quite  distinct  parts  are  very  curious ;  and  many  instances  are  given  in  Isidore  Geoffroy  St .  Hilaire ' s  great  work  on  this  subject .  Breeders  believe  that  long  limbs  are  almost  always  accompanied  by  an  elongated  head .  Some  instances  of  correlation  are  quite  whimsical :  thus  cats  with  blue  eyes  are  invariably  deaf ;  colour  and  constitutional  peculiarities  go  together ,  of  which  many  remarkable  cases  could  be  given  amongst  animals  and  plants .  From  the  facts  collected  by  Heusinger ,  it  appears  that  white  sheep  and  pigs  are  differently  affected  from  coloured  individuals  by  certain  vegetable  poisons .  Hairless  dogs  have  imperfect  teeth ;  long - haired  and  coarse - haired  animals  are  apt  to  have ,  as  is  asserted ,  long  or  many  horns ;  pigeons  with  feathered  feet  have  skin  between  their  outer  toes ;  pigeons  with  short  beaks  have  small  feet ,  and  those  with  long  beaks  large  feet .  Hence ,  if  man  goes  on  selecting ,  and  thus  augmenting ,  any  peculiarity ,  he  will  almost  certainly  unconsciously  modify  other  parts  of  the  structure ,  owing  to  the  mysterious  laws  of  the  correlation  of  growth .

 The  result  of  the  various ,  quite  unknown ,  or  dimly  seen  laws  of  variation  is  infinitely  complex  and  diversified .  It  is  well  worth  while  carefully  to  study  the  several  treatises  published  on  some  of  our  old  cultivated  plants ,  as  on  the  hyacinth ,  potato ,  even  the  dahlia ,  &amp; c . ;  and  it  is  really  surprising  to  note  the  endless  points  in  structure  and  constitution  in  which  the  varieties  and  sub - varieties  differ  slightly  from  each  other .  The  whole  organisation  seems  to  have  become  plastic ,  and  tends  to  depart  in  some  small  degree  from  that  of  the  parental  type .

 Any  variation  which  is  not  inherited  is  unimportant  for  us .  But  the  number  and  diversity  of  inheritable  deviations  of  structure ,  both  those  of  slight  and  those  of  considerable  physiological  importance ,  is  endless .  Dr .  Prosper  Lucas ' s  treatise ,  in  two  large  volumes ,  is  the  fullest  and  the  best  on  this  subject .  No  breeder  doubts  how  strong  is  the  tendency  to  inheritance :  like  produces  like  is  his  fundamental  belief :  doubts  have  been  thrown  on  this  principle  by  theoretical  writers  alone .  When  a  deviation  appears  not  unfrequently ,  and  we  see  it  in  the  father  and  child ,  we  cannot  tell  whether  it  may  not  be  due  to  the  same  original  cause  acting  on  both ;  but  when  amongst  individuals ,  apparently  exposed  to  the  same  conditions ,  any  very  rare  deviation ,  due  to  some  extraordinary  combination  of  circumstances ,  appears  in  the  parent  —  say ,  once  amongst  several  million  individuals  —  and  it  reappears  in  the  child ,  the  mere  doctrine  of  chances  almost  compels  us  to  attribute  its  reappearance  to  inheritance .  Every  one  must  have  heard  of  cases  of  albinism ,  prickly  skin ,  hairy  bodies ,  &amp; c . ,  appearing  in  several  members  of  the  same  family .  If  strange  and  rare  deviations  of  structure  are  truly  inherited ,  less  strange  and  commoner  deviations  may  be  freely  admitted  to  be  inheritable .  Perhaps  the  correct  way  of  viewing  the  whole  subject ,  would  be ,  to  look  at  the  inheritance  of  every  character  whatever  as  the  rule ,  and  non - inheritance  as  the  anomaly .

 The  laws  governing  inheritance  are  quite  unknown ;  no  one  can  say  why  the  same  peculiarity  in  different  individuals  of  the  same  species ,  and  in  individuals  of  different  species ,  is  sometimes  inherited  and  sometimes  not  so ;  why  the  child  often  reverts  in  certain  characters  to  its  grandfather  or  grandmother  or  other  much  more  remote  ancestor ;  why  a  peculiarity  is  often  transmitted  from  one  sex  to  both  sexes ,  or  to  one  sex  alone ,  more  commonly  but  not  exclusively  to  the  like  sex .  It  is  a  fact  of  some  little  importance  to  us ,  that  peculiarities  appearing  in  the  males  of  our  domestic  breeds  are  often  transmitted  either  exclusively ,  or  in  a  much  greater  degree ,  to  males  alone .  A  much  more  important  rule ,  which  I  think  may  be  trusted ,  is  that ,  at  whatever  period  of  life  a  peculiarity  first  appears ,  it  tends  to  appear  in  the  offspring  at  a  corresponding  age ,  though  sometimes  earlier .  In  many  cases  this  could  not  be  otherwise :  thus  the  inherited  peculiarities  in  the  horns  of  cattle  could  appear  only  in  the  offspring  when  nearly  mature ;  peculiarities  in  the  silkworm  are  known  to  appear  at  the  corresponding  caterpillar  or  cocoon  stage .  But  hereditary  diseases  and  some  other  facts  make  me  believe  that  the  rule  has  a  wider  extension ,  and  that  when  there  is  no  apparent  reason  why  a  peculiarity  should  appear  at  any  particular  age ,  yet  that  it  does  tend  to  appear  in  the  offspring  at  the  same  period  at  which  it  first  appeared  in  the  parent .  I  believe  this  rule  to  be  of  the  highest  importance  in  explaining  the  laws  of  embryology .  These  remarks  are  of  course  confined  to  the  first  appearance  of  the  peculiarity ,  and  not  to  its  primary  cause ,  which  may  have  acted  on  the  ovules  or  male  element ;  in  nearly  the  same  manner  as  in  the  crossed  offspring  from  a  short - horned  cow  by  a  long - horned  bull ,  the  greater  length  of  horn ,  though  appearing  late  in  life ,  is  clearly  due  to  the  male  element .

 Having  alluded  to  the  subject  of  reversion ,  I  may  here  refer  to  a  statement  often  made  by  naturalists  —  namely ,  that  our  domestic  varieties ,  when  run  wild ,  gradually  but  certainly  revert  in  character  to  their  aboriginal  stocks .  Hence  it  has  been  argued  that  no  deductions  can  be  drawn  from  domestic  races  to  species  in  a  state  of  nature .  I  have  in  vain  endeavoured  to  discover  on  what  decisive  facts  the  above  statement  has  so  often  and  so  boldly  been  made .  There  would  be  great  difficulty  in  proving  its  truth :  we  may  safely  conclude  that  very  many  of  the  most  strongly - marked  domestic  varieties  could  not  possibly  live  in  a  wild  state .  In  many  cases  we  do  not  know  what  the  aboriginal  stock  was ,  and  so  could  not  tell  whether  or  not  nearly  perfect  reversion  had  ensued .  It  would  be  quite  necessary ,  in  order  to  prevent  the  effects  of  intercrossing ,  that  only  a  single  variety  should  be  turned  loose  in  its  new  home .  Nevertheless ,  as  our  varieties  certainly  do  occasionally  revert  in  some  of  their  characters  to  ancestral  forms ,  it  seems  to  me  not  improbable ,  that  if  we  could  succeed  in  naturalising ,  or  were  to  cultivate ,  during  many  generations ,  the  several  races ,  for  instance ,  of  the  cabbage ,  in  very  poor  soil  ( in  which  case ,  however ,  some  effect  would  have  to  be  attributed  to  the  direct  action  of  the  poor  soil ) ,  that  they  would  to  a  large  extent ,  or  even  wholly ,  revert  to  the  wild  aboriginal  stock .  Whether  or  not  the  experiment  would  succeed ,  is  not  of  great  importance  for  our  line  of  argument ;  for  by  the  experiment  itself  the  conditions  of  life  are  changed .  If  it  could  be  shown  that  our  domestic  varieties  manifested  a  strong  tendency  to  reversion ,  —  that  is ,  to  lose  their  acquired  characters ,  whilst  kept  under  unchanged  conditions ,  and  whilst  kept  in  a  considerable  body ,  so  that  free  intercrossing  might  check ,  by  blending  together ,  any  slight  deviations  of  structure ,  in  such  case ,  I  grant  that  we  could  deduce  nothing  from  domestic  varieties  in  regard  to  species .  But  there  is  not  a  shadow  of  evidence  in  favour  of  this  view :  to  assert  that  we  could  not  breed  our  cart  and  race - horses ,  long  and  short - horned  cattle ,  and  poultry  of  various  breeds ,  and  esculent  vegetables ,  for  an  almost  infinite  number  of  generations ,  would  be  opposed  to  all  experience</td><td>not  perfectly  like  their  parents .

 Habit  also  has  a  decided  influence ,  as  in  the  period  of  flowering  with  plants  when  transported  from  one  climate  to  another .  In  animals  it  has  a  more  marked  effect ;  for  instance ,  I  find  in  the  domestic  duck  that  the  bones  of  the  wing  weigh  less  and  the  bones  of  the  leg  more ,  in  proportion  to  the  whole  skeleton ,  than  do  the  same  bones  in  the  wild - duck ;  and  I  presume  that  this  change  may  be  safely  attributed  to  the  domestic  duck  flying  much  less ,  and  walking  more ,  than  its  wild  parent .  The  great  and  inherited  development  of  the  udders  in  cows  and  goats  in  countries  where  they  are  habitually  milked ,  in  comparison  with  the  state  of  these  organs  in  other  countries ,  is  another  instance  of  the  effect  of  use .  Not  a  single  domestic  animal  can  be  named  which  has  not  in  some  country  drooping  ears ;  and  the  view  suggested  by  some  authors ,  that  the  drooping  is  due  to  the  disuse  of  the  muscles  of  the  ear ,  from  the  animals  not  being  much  alarmed  by  danger ,  seems  probable .

 There  are  many  laws  regulating  variation ,  some  few  of  which  can  be  dimly  seen ,  and  will  be  hereafter  briefly  mentioned .  I  will  here  only  allude  to  what  may  be  called  correlation  of  growth .  Any  change  in  the  embryo  or  larva  will  almost  certainly  entail  changes  in  the  mature  animal .  In  monstrosities ,  the  correlations  between  quite  distinct  parts  are  very  curious ;  and  many  instances  are  given  in  Isidore  Geoffroy  St .  Hilaire ' s  great  work  on  this  subject .  Breeders  believe  that  long  limbs  are  almost  always  accompanied  by  an  elongated  head .  Some  instances  of  correlation  are  quite  whimsical :  thus  cats  with  blue  eyes  are  invariably  deaf ;  colour  and  constitutional  peculiarities  go  together ,  of  which  many  remarkable  cases  could  be  given  amongst  animals  and  plants .  From  the  facts  collected  by  Heusinger ,  it  appears  that  white  sheep  and  pigs  are  differently  affected  from  coloured  individuals  by  certain  vegetable  poisons .  Hairless  dogs  have  imperfect  teeth :  long - haired  and  coarse - haired  animals  are  apt  to  have ,  as  is  asserted ,  long  or  many  horns ;  pigeons  with  feathered  feet  have  skin  between  their  outer  toes ;  pigeons  with  short  beaks  have  small  feet ,  and  those  with  long  beaks  large  feet .  Hence ,  if  man  goes  on  selecting ,  and  thus  augmenting ,  any  peculiarity ,  he  will  almost  certainly  unconsciously  modify  other  parts  of  the  structure ,  owing  to  the  mysterious  laws  of  the  correlation  of  growth .

 The  result  of  the  various ,  quite  unknown ,  or  dimly  seen  laws  of  variation  is  infinitely  complex  and  diversified .  It  is  well  worth  while  carefully  to  study  the  several  treatises  published  on  some  of  our  old  cultivated  plants ,  as  on  the  hyacinth ,  potato ,  even  the  dahlia ,  &amp; c . ;  and  it  is  really  surprising  to  note  the  endless  points  in  structure  and  constitution  in  which  the  varieties  and  sub - varieties  differ  slightly  from  each  other .  The  whole  organisation  seems  to  have  become  plastic ,  and  tends  to  depart  in  some  small  degree  from  that  of  the  parental  type .

 Any  variation  which  is  not  inherited  is  unimportant  for  us .  But  the  number  and  diversity  of  inheritable  deviations  of  structure ,  both  those  of  slight  and  those  of  considerable  physiological  importance ,  is  endless .  Dr .  Prosper  Lucas ' s  treatise ,  in  two  large  volumes ,  is  the  fullest  and  the  best  on  this  subject .  No  breeder  doubts  how  strong  is  the  tendency  to  inheritance :  like  produces  like  is  his  fundamental  belief :  doubts  have  been  thrown  on  this  principle  by  theoretical  writers  alone .  When  any  deviation  of  structure  often  appears ,  and  we  see  it  in  the  father  and  child ,  we  cannot  tell  whether  it  may  not  be  due  to  the  same  cause  having  acted  on  both ;  but  when  amongst  individuals ,  apparently  exposed  to  the  same  conditions ,  any  very  rare  deviation ,  due  to  some  extraordinary  combination  of  circumstances ,  appears  in  the  parent  —  say ,  once  amongst  several  million  individuals  —  and  it  reappears  in  the  child ,  the  mere  doctrine  of  chances  almost  compels  us  to  attribute  its  reappearance  to  inheritance .  Every  one  must  have  heard  of  cases  of  albinism ,  prickly  skin ,  hairy  bodies ,  &amp; c . ,  appearing  in  several  members  of  the  same  family .  If  strange  and  rare  deviations  of  structure  are  truly  inherited ,  less  strange  and  commoner  deviations  may  be  freely  admitted  to  be  inheritable .  Perhaps  the  correct  way  of  viewing  the  whole  subject ,  would  be ,  to  look  at  the  inheritance  of  every  character  whatever  as  the  rule ,  and  non - inheritance  as  the  anomaly .

 The  laws  governing  inheritance  are  quite  unknown ;  no  one  can  say  why  a  peculiarity  in  different  individuals  of  the  same  species ,  or  in  individuals  of  different  species ,  is  sometimes  inherited  and  sometimes  not  so ;  why  the  child  often  reverts  in  certain  characters  to  its  grandfather  or  grandmother  or  other  more  remote  ancestor ;  why  a  peculiarity  is  often  transmitted  from  one  sex  to  both  sexes ,  or  to  one  sex  alone ,  more  commonly  but  not  exclusively  to  the  like  sex .  It  is  a  fact  of  some  little  importance  to  us ,  that  peculiarities  appearing  in  the  males  of  our  domestic  breeds  are  often  transmitted  either  exclusively ,  or  in  a  much  greater  degree ,  to  males  alone .  A  much  more  important  rule ,  which  I  think  may  be  trusted ,  is  that ,  at  whatever  period  of  life  a  peculiarity  first  appears ,  it  tends  to  appear  in  the  offspring  at  a  corresponding  age ,  though  sometimes  earlier .  In  many  cases  this  could  not  be  otherwise :  thus  the  inherited  peculiarities  in  the  horns  of  cattle  could  appear  only  in  the  offspring  when  nearly  mature ;  peculiarities  in  the  silkworm  are  known  to  appear  at  the  corresponding  caterpillar  or  cocoon  stage .  But  hereditary  diseases  and  some  other  facts  make  me  believe  that  the  rule  has  a  wider  extension ,  and  that  when  there  is  no  apparent  reason  why  a  peculiarity  should  appear  at  any  particular  age ,  yet  that  it  does  tend  to  appear  in  the  offspring  at  the  same  period  at  which  it  first  appeared  in  the  parent .  I  believe  this  rule  to  be  of  the  highest  importance  in  explaining  the  laws  of  embryology .  These  remarks  are  of  course  confined  to  the  first  appearance  of  the  peculiarity ,  and  not  to  its  primary  cause ,  which  may  have  acted  on  the  ovules  or  male  element ;  in  nearly  the  same  manner  as  in  the  crossed  offspring  from  a  short - horned  cow  by  a  long - horned  bull ,  the  greater  length  of  horn ,  though  appearing  late  in  life ,  is  clearly  due  to  the  male  element .

 Having  alluded  to  the  subject  of  reversion ,  I  may  here  refer  to  a  statement  often  made  by  naturalists  —  namely ,  that  our  domestic  varieties ,  when  run  wild ,  gradually  but  certainly  revert  in  character  to  their  aboriginal  stocks .  Hence  it  has  been  argued  that  no  deductions  can  be  drawn  from  domestic  races  to  species  in  a  state  of  nature .  I  have  in  vain  endeavoured  to  discover  on  what  decisive  facts  the  above  statement  has  so  often  and  so  boldly  been  made .  There  would  be  great  difficulty  in  proving  its  truth :  we  may  safely  conclude  that  very  many  of  the  most  strongly - marked  domestic  varieties  could  not  possibly  live  in  a  wild  state .  In  many  cases  we  do  not  know  what  the  aboriginal  stock  was ,  and  so  could  not  tell  whether  or  not  nearly  perfect  reversion  had  ensued .  It  would  be  quite  necessary ,  in  order  to  prevent  the  effects  of  intercrossing ,  that  only  a  single  variety  should  be  turned  loose  in  its  new  home .  Nevertheless ,  as  our  varieties  certainly  do  occasionally  revert  in  some  of  their  characters  to  ancestral  forms ,  it  seems  to  me  not  improbable ,  that  if  we  could  succeed  in  naturalising ,  or  were  to  cultivate ,  during  many  generations ,  the  several  races ,  for  instance ,  of  the  cabbage ,  in  very  poor  soil  ( in  which  case ,  however ,  some  effect  would  have  to  be  attributed  to  the  direct  action  of  the  poor  soil ) ,  that  they  would  to  a  large  extent ,  or  even  wholly ,  revert  to  the  wild  aboriginal  stock .  Whether  or  not  the  experiment  would  succeed ,  is  not  of  great  importance  for  our  line  of  argument ;  for  by  the  experiment  itself  the  conditions  of  life  are  changed .  If  it  could  be  shown  that  our  domestic  varieties  manifested  a  strong  tendency  to  reversion ,  —  that  is ,  to  lose  their  acquired  characters ,  whilst  kept  under  the  same  conditions ,  and  whilst  kept  in  a  considerable  body ,  so  that  free  intercrossing  might  check ,  by  blending  together ,  any  slight  deviations  in  their  structure ,  in  such  case ,  I  grant  that  we  could  deduce  nothing  from  domestic  varieties  in  regard  to  species .  But  there  is  not  a  shadow  of  evidence  in  favour  of  this  view :  to  assert  that  we  could  not  breed  our  cart  and  race - horses ,  long  and  short - horned  cattle ,  and  poultry  of  various  breeds ,  and  esculent  vegetables ,  for  an  almost  infinite  number  of  generations ,  would  be  opposed  to  all  experience</td><td>not  perfectly  like  their  parents .

In  animals  it  has  a  more  marked  effect ;  for  instance ,  I  find  in  the  domestic  duck  that  the  bones  of  the  wing  weigh  less  and  the  bones  of  the  leg  more ,  in  proportion  to  the  whole  skeleton ,  than  do  the  same  bones  in  the  wild - duck ;  and  I  presume  that  this  change  may  be  safely  attributed  to  the  domestic  duck  flying  much  less ,  and  walking  more ,  than  its  wild  parent .  The  great  and  inherited  development  of  the  udders  in  cows  and  goats  in  countries  where  they  are  habitually  milked ,  in  comparison  with  the  state  of  these  organs  in  other  countries ,  is  another  instance  of  the  effect  of  use .  Not  a  single  domestic  animal  can  be  named  which  has  not  in  some  country  drooping  ears ;  and  the  view  suggested  by  some  authors ,  that  the  drooping  is  due  to  the  disuse  of  the  muscles  of  the  ear ,  from  the  animals  not  being  much  alarmed  by  danger ,  seems  probable .

Florida  squatters )  added ,  &quot; we  select  the  black  members  of  a  litter  for  raising ,  as  they  alone  have  a  good  chance  of  living . &quot;  Hairless  dogs  have  imperfect  teeth :  long - haired  and  coarse - haired  animals  are  apt  to  have ,  as  is  asserted ,  long  or  many  horns ;  pigeons  with  feathered  feet  have  skin  between  their  outer  toes ;  pigeons  with  short  beaks  have  small  feet ,  and  those  with  long  beaks  large  feet .

It  is  a  fact  of  some  little  importance  to  us ,  that  peculiarities  appearing  in  the  males  of  our  domestic  breeds  are  often  transmitted  either  exclusively ,  or  in  a  much  greater  degree ,  to  males  alone .  A  much  more  important  rule ,  which  I  think  may  be  trusted ,  is  that ,  at  whatever  period  of  life  a  peculiarity  first  appears ,  it  tends  to  appear  in  the  offspring  at  a  corresponding  age ,  though  sometimes  earlier .  In  many  cases  this  could  not  be  otherwise :  thus  the  inherited  peculiarities  in  the  horns  of  cattle  could  appear  only  in  the  offspring  when  nearly  mature ;  peculiarities  in  the  silkworm  are  known  to  appear  at  the  corresponding  caterpillar  or  cocoon  stage .

I  have  in  vain  endeavoured  to  discover  on  what  decisive  facts  the  above  statement  has  so  often  and  so  boldly  been  made .  There  would  be  great  difficulty  in  proving  its  truth :  we  may  safely  conclude  that  very  many  of  the  most  strongly - marked  domestic  varieties  could  not  possibly  live  in  a  wild  state .  In  many  cases  we  do  not  know  what  the  aboriginal  stock  was ,  and  so  could  not  tell  whether  or  not  nearly  perfect  reversion  had  ensued .

 Effects  of  Habit ;  Correlation  of  Growth ;  Inheritance .  Habit  also  has  a  decided  influence ,  as  in  the  period  of  flowering  with  plants  when  transported  from  one  climate  to  another .  In  animals  it  has  a  more  marked  effect ;  for  instance ,  I  find  in  the  domestic  duck  that  the  bones  of  the  wing  weigh  less  and  the  bones  of  the  leg  more ,  in  proportion  to  the  whole  skeleton ,  than  do  the  same  bones  in  the  wild - duck ;  and  I  presume  that  this  change  may  be  safely  attributed  to  the  domestic  duck  flying  much  less ,  and  walking  more ,  than  its  wild  parent .  The  great  and  inherited  development  of  the  udders  in  cows  and  goats  in  countries  where  they  are  habitually  milked ,  in  comparison  with  the  state  of  these  organs  in  other  countries ,  is  probably  another  instance  of  the  effects  of  use .  Not  a  single  domestic  animal  can  be  named  which  has  not  in  some  country  drooping  ears ;  and  the  view  which  has  been  suggested  that  the  drooping  is  due  to  the  disuse  of  the  muscles  of  the  ear ,  from  the  animals  being  seldom  alarmed  by  danger ,  seems  probable .

 There  are  many  laws  regulating  variation ,  some  few  of  which  can  be  dimly  seen ,  and  will  be  hereafter  briefly  mentioned .  I  will  here  only  allude  to  what  may  be  called  correlation  of  growth .  Any  change  in  the  embryo  or  larva  will  probably  entail  changes  in  the  mature  animal .  In  monstrosities ,  the  correlations  between  quite  distinct  parts  are  very  curious ;  and  many  instances  are  given  in  Isidore  Geoffroy  St .

Some  instances  of  correlation  are  quite  whimsical :  thus  cats  which  are  entirely  white  and  have  blue  eyes  are  generally  deaf .  Colour  and  constitutional  peculiarities  go  together ,  of  which  many  remarkable  cases  could  be  given  amongst  animals  and  plants .  From  facts  collected  by  Heusinger ,  it  appears  that  white  sheep  and  pigs  are  injured  by  certain  plants ,  whilst  dark - coloured  individuals  escape :  Professor  Wyman  has  recently  communicated  to  me  a  good  illustration  of  this  fact ;  on  asking  some  farmers  in  Florida  how  it  was  that  all  their  pigs  were  black ,  they  informed  him  that  the  pigs  ate  the  paint - root  ( Lachnanthes ) ,  which  coloured  their  bones  pink ,  and  which  caused  the  hoofs  of  all  but  the  black  varieties  to  drop  off ;  and  one  of  the  &quot; crackers &quot;  (  i . e .  Florida  squatters )  added ,  &quot; we  select  the  black  members  of  a  litter  for  raising ,  as  they  alone  have  a  good  chance  of  living . &quot;  Hairless  dogs  have  imperfect  teeth :  long - haried  and  coarse - haired  animals  are  apt  to  have ,  as  is  asserted ,  long  or  many  horns ;  pigeons  with  feathered  feet  have  skin  between  their  outer  toes ;  pigeons  with  short  beaks  have  small  feet ,  and  those  with  long  beaks  large  feet .  Hence  if  man  goes  on  selecting ,  and  thus  augmenting ,  any  peculiarity ,  he  will  almost  certainly  unintentionally  modify  other  parts  of  the  structure ,  owing  to  the  mysterious  laws  of  the  correlation  of  growth .

 The  result  of  the  various ,  quite  unknown ,  or  dimly  seen  laws  of  variation  is  infinitely  complex  and  diversified .  It  is  well  worth  while  carefully  to  study  the  several  treatises  on  some  of  our  old  cultivated  plants ,  as  on  the  hyacinth ,  potato ,  even  the  dahlia ,  &amp; c . ;  and  it  is  really  surprising  to  note  the  endless  points  in  structure  and  constitution  in  which  the  varieties  and  sub - varieties  differ  slightly  from  each  other .  The  whole  organisation  seems  to  have  become  plastic ,  and  tends  to  depart  in  some  small  degree  from  that  of  the  parental  type .

 Any  variation  which  is  not  inherited  is  unimportant  for  us .  But  the  number  and  diversity  of  inheritable  deviations  of  structure ,  both  those  of  slight  and  those  of  considerable  physiological  importance ,  are  endless .  Dr .  Prosper  Lucas ' s  treatise ,  in  two  large  volumes ,  is  the  fullest  and  the  best  on  this  subject .  No  breeder  doubts  how  strong  is  the  tendency  to  inheritance :  like  produces  like  is  his  fundamental  belief :  doubts  have  been  thrown  on  this  principle  by  theoretical  writers  alone .  When  any  deviation  of  structure  often  appears ,  and  we  see  it  in  the  father  and  child ,  we  cannot  tell  whether  it  may  not  be  due  to  the  same  cause  having  acted  on  both ;  but  when  amongst  individuals ,  apparently  exposed  to  the  same  conditions ,  any  very  rare  deviation ,  due  to  some  extraordinary  combination  of  circumstances ,  appears  in  the  parent  —  say ,  once  amongst  several  million  individuals  —  and  it  reappears  in  the  child ,  the  mere  doctrine  of  chances  almost  compels  us  to  attribute  its  reappearance  to  inheritance .  Every  one  must  have  heard  of  cases  of  albinism ,  prickly  skin ,  hairy  bodies ,  &amp; c . ,  appearing  in  several  members  of  the  same  family .  If  strange  and  rare  deviations  of  structure  are  really  inherited ,  less  strange  and  commoner  deviations  may  be  freely  admitted  to  be  inheritable .  Perhaps  the  correct  way  of  viewing  the  whole  subject ,  would  be ,  to  look  at  the  inheritance  of  every  character  whatever  as  the  rule ,  and  non - inheritance  as  the  anomaly .

 The  laws  governing  inheritance  are  quite  unknown ;  no  one  can  say  why  a  peculiarity  in  different  individuals  of  the  same  species ,  or  in  individuals  of  different  species ,  is  sometimes  inherited  and  sometimes  not  so ;  why  the  child  often  reverts  in  certain  characters  to  its  grandfather  or  grandmother  or  other  more  remote  ancestor ;  why  a  peculiarity  is  often  transmitted  from  one  sex  to  both  sexes ,  or  to  one  sex  alone ,  more  commonly  but  not  exclusively  to  the  like  sex .  It  is  a  fact  of  some  little  importance  to  us ,  that  peculiarities  appearing  in  the  males  of  our  domestic  breeds  are  often  transmitted ,  either  exclusively  or  in  a  much  greater  degree ,  to  males  alone .  A  much  more  important  rule ,  which  I  think  may  be  trusted ,  is  that ,  at  whatever  period  of  life  a  peculiarity  first  appears ,  it  tends  to  appear  in  the  offspring  at  a  corresponding  age ,  though  sometimes  earlier .  In  many  cases  this  could  not  be  otherwise :  thus  the  inherited  peculiarities  in  the  horns  of  cattle  could  appear  only  in  the  offspring  when  nearly  mature ;  peculiarities  in  the  silkworm  are  known  to  appear  at  the  corresponding  caterpillar  or  cocoon  stage .  But  hereditary  diseases  and  some  other  facts  make  me  believe  that  the  rule  has  a  wider  extension ,  and  that ,  when  there  is  no  apparent  reason  why  a  peculiarity  should  appear  at  any  particular  age ,  yet  that  it  does  tend  to  appear  in  the  offspring  at  the  same  period  at  which  it  first  appeared  in  the  parent .  I  believe  this  rule  to  be  of  the  highest  importance  in  explaining  the  laws  of  embryology .  These  remarks  are  of  course  confined  to  the  first  appearance  of  the  peculiarity ,  and  not  to  its  primary  cause ,  which  may  have  acted  on  the  ovules  or  on  the  male  element ;  in  nearly  the  same  manner  as  in  the  offspring  from  a  short - horned  cow  by  a  long - horned  bull ,  the  greater  length  of  horn ,  though  appearing  late  in  life ,  is  clearly  due  to  the  male  element .

 Having  alluded  to  the  subject  of  reversion ,  I  may  here  refer  to  a  statement  often  made  by  naturalists  —  namely ,  that  our  domestic  varieties ,  when  run  wild ,  gradually  but  certainly  revert  in  character  to  their  aboriginal  stocks .  Hence  it  has  been  argued  that  no  deductions  can  be  drawn  from  domestic  races  to  species  in  a  state  of  nature .  I  have  in  vain  endeavoured  to  discover  on  what  decisive  facts  the  above  statement  has  so  often  and  so  boldly  been  made .  There  would  be  great  difficulty  in  proving  its  truth :  we  may  safely  conclude  that  very  many  of  the  most  strongly - marked  domestic  varieties  could  not  possibly  live  in  a  wild  state .  In  many  cases  we  do  not  know  what  the  aboriginal  stock  was ,  and  so  could  not  tell  whether  or  not  nearly  perfect  reversion  had  ensued .  It  would  be  quite  necessary ,  in  order  to  prevent  the  effects  of  intercrossing ,  that  only  a  single  variety  should  be  turned  loose  in  its  new  home .  Nevertheless ,  as  our  varieties  certainly  do  occasionally  revert  in  some  of  their  characters  to  ancestral  forms ,  it  seems  to  me  not  improbable ,  that  if  we  could  succeed  in  naturalising ,  or  were  to  cultivate ,  during  many  generations ,  the  several  races ,  for  instance ,  of  the  cabbage ,  in  very  poor  soil  ( in  which  case ,  however ,  some  effect  would  have  to  be  attributed  to  the  direct  action  of  the  poor  soil ) ,  that  they  would  to  a  large  extent ,  or  even  wholly ,  revert  to  the  wild  aboriginal  stock .  Whether  or  not  the  experiment  would  succeed ,  is  not  of  great  importance  for  our  line  of  argument ;  for  by  the  experiment  itself  the  conditions  of  life  are  changed .  If  it  could  be  shown  that  our  domestic  varieties  manifested  a  strong  tendency  to  reversion ,  —  that  is ,  to  lose  their  acquired  characters ,  whilst  kept  under  the  same  conditions ,  and  whilst  kept  in  a  considerable  body ,  so  that  free  intercrossing  might  check ,  by  blending  together ,  any  slight  deviations  in  their  structure ,  in  such  case ,  I  grant  that  we  could  deduce  nothing  from  domestic  varieties  in  regard  to  species .  But  there  is  not  a  shadow  of  evidence  in  favour  of  this  view :  to  assert  that  we  could  not  breed  our  cart  and  race - horses ,  long  and  short - horned  cattle ,  and  poultry  of  various  breeds ,  and  esculent  vegetables ,  for  an  almost  infinite  number  of  generations ,  would  be  opposed  to  all  experience</td><td>somewhat  unlike  their  parents</td><td>somewhat  unlike  their  parents</td></tr><tr class="aligned"><td>78</td><td>Aligned</td><td colspan="6">. i may add , that</td></tr><tr class="expanded"><td>79</td><td>Expanded</td><td>the  conditions  of  life  do  change ,  variations  and  reversions  of  character  probably  do  occur ;  but  natural  selection ,  as  will  hereafter  be  explained ,  will  determine  how  far  the  new  characters  thus  arising  shall  be  preserved</td><td>the  conditions  of  life  do  change ,  variations  and  reversions  of  character  probably  do  occur ;  but  natural  selection ,  as  will  hereafter  be  explained ,  will  determine  how  far  the  new  characters  thus  arising  shall  be  preserved</td><td>the  conditions  of  life  do  change ,  variations  and  reversions  of  character  probably  do  occur ;  but  natural  selection ,  as  will  hereafter  be  explained ,  will  determine  how  far  the  new  characters  thus  arising  shall  be  preserved</td><td>the  conditions  of  life  do  change ,  variations  and  reversions  of  character  probably  do  occur ;  but  natural  selection ,  as  will  hereafter  be  explained ,  will  determine  how  far  the  new  characters  thus  arising  shall  be  preserved .

 Character  of  Domestic  Varieties ;  difficulty  of  distinguishing  between  Varieties  and  Species ;  origin  of  Domestic  Varieties  from  one  or  more  Species</td><td>,  but  far  from  rarely  under  culture .  As  a  single  bud  out  of  the  many  thousands  produced  year  after  year  under  uniform  conditions  on  the  same  tree ,  has  been  known  suddenly  to  assume  a  new  character ;  and  as  buds  on  distinct  trees ,  growing  under  different  conditions ,  have  sometimes  yielded  nearly  the  same  variety  —  for  instance ,  buds  on  peach - trees  producing  nectarines ,  and  buds  on  common  roses  producing  moss - roses  —  we  clearly  see  that  the  nature  of  the  conditions  is  of  quite  subordinate  importance  in  comparison  with  the  nature  of  the  organism  in  determining  each  particular  form  of  variation ;  —  of  not  more  importance  than  the  nature  of  the  spark  by  which  a  mass  of  combustible  matter  is  ignited ,  has  in  determining  the  nature  of  the  flames .

 Effects  of  Habit ;  Correlated  Variation ;  Inheritance .  Habits  are  inherited  and  have  a  decided  influence ;  as  in  the  period  of  the  flowering  of  plants  when  transported  from  one  climate  to  another .  In  animals  they  have  a  more  marked  effect ;  for  instance ,  I  find  in  the  domestic  duck  that  the  bones  of  the  wing  weigh  less  and  the  bones  of  the  leg  more ,  in  proportion  to  the  whole  skeleton ,  than  do  the  same  bones  in  the  wild - duck ;  and  this  change  may  be  safely  attributed  to  the  domestic  duck  flying  much  less ,  and  walking  more ,  than  its  wild  parents .  The  great  and  inherited  development  of  the  udders  in  cows  and  goats  in  countries  where  they  are  habitually  milked ,  in  comparison  with  the  state  of  these  organs  in  other  countries ,  is  probably  another  instance  of  the  effects  of  use .  Not  one  of  our  domestic  animals  can  be  named  which  has  not  in  some  country  drooping  ears ;  and  the  view  which  has  been  suggested  that  the  drooping  is  due  to  the  disuse  of  the  muscles  of  the  ear ,  from  the  animals  being  seldom  alarmed  by  danger ,  seems  probable .

 Many  laws  regulate  variation ,  some  few  of  which  can  be  dimly  seen ,  and  will  hereafter  be  briefly  discussed .  I  will  here  only  allude  to  what  may  be  called  correlated  variation .  Important  changes  in  the  embryo  or  larva  will  probably  entail  changes  in  the  mature  animal .  In  monstrosities ,  the  correlations  between  quite  distinct  parts  are  very  curious ;  and  many  instances  are  given  in  Isidore  Geoffroy  St .  Hilaire ' s  great  work  on  this  subject .  Breeders  believe  that  long  limbs  are  almost  always  accompanied  by  an  elongated  head .  Some  instances  of  correlation  are  quite  whimsical :  thus  cats  which  are  entirely  white  and  have  blue  eyes  are  generally  deaf .  Colour  and  constitutional  peculiarities  go  together ,  of  which  many  remarkable  cases  could  be  given  amongst  animals  and  plants .  From  facts  collected  by  Heusinger ,  it  appears  that  white  sheep  and  pigs  are  injured  by  certain  plants ,  whilst  dark - coloured  individuals  escape :  Professor  Wyman  has  recently  communicated  to  me  a  good  illustration  of  this  fact ;  on  asking  some  farmers  in  Florida  how  it  was  that  all  their  pigs  were  black ,  they  informed  him  that  the  pigs  ate  the  paint - root  ( Lachnanthes ) ,  which  coloured  their  bones  pink ,  and  which  caused  the  hoofs  of  all  but  the  black  varieties  to  drop  off ;  and  one  of  the  &quot; crackers &quot;  (  I .  e .  Florida  squatters )  added ,  &quot; we  select  the  black  members  of  a  litter  for  raising ,  as  they  alone  have  a  good  chance  of  living . &quot;  Hairless  dogs  have  imperfect  teeth :  long - haired  and  coarse - haired  animals  are  apt  to  have ,  as  is  asserted ,  long  or  many  horns ;  pigeons  with  feathered  feet  have  skin  between  their  outer  toes ;  pigeons  with  short  beaks  have  small  feet ,  and  those  with  long  beaks  large  feet .  Hence  if  man  goes  on  selecting ,  and  thus  augmenting ,  any  peculiarity ,  he  will  almost  certainly  modify  unintentionally  other  parts  of  the  structure ,  owing  to  the  mysterious  laws  of  correlation .

 The  results  of  the  various ,  unknown ,  or  but  dimly  understood  laws  of  variation  are  infinitely  complex  and  diversified .

 Effects  of  Habit  and  of  the  Use  or  Disuse  of  Parts ;  Correlated  Variation ;  Inheritance .  Changed  habits  produce  an  inherited  effect ,  as  in  the  period  of  the  flowering  of  plants  when  transported  from  one  climate  to  another .  With  animals  the  increased  use  or  disuse  of  parts  has  had  a  more  marked  influence ;  thus  I  find  in  the  domestic  duck  that  the  bones  of  the  wing  weigh  less  and  the  bones  of  the  leg  more ,  in  proportion  to  the  whole  skeleton ,  than  do  the  same  bones  in  the  wild  duck ;  and  this  change  may  be  safely  attributed  to  the  domestic  duck  flying  much  less ,  and  walking  more ,  than  its  wild  parents .

 Any  variation  which  is  not  inherited  is  unimportant  for  us .  But  the  number  and  diversity  of  inheritable  deviations  of  structure ,  both  those  of  slight  and  those  of  considerable  physiological  importance ,  are  endless .  Dr .  Prosper  Lucas ' s  treatise ,  in  two  large  volumes ,  is  the  fullest  and  the  best  on  this  subject .  No  breeder  doubts  how  strong  is  the  tendency  to  inheritance ;  that  like  produces  like  is  his  fundamental  belief :  doubts  have  been  thrown  on  this  principle  only  by  theoretical  writers .  When  any  deviation  of  structure  often  appears ,  and  we  see  it  in  the  father  and  child ,  we  cannot  tell  whether  it  may  not  be  due  to  the  same  cause  having  acted  on  both ;  but  when  amongst  individuals ,  apparently  exposed  to  the  same  conditions ,  any  very  rare  deviation ,  due  to  some  extraordinary  combination  of  circumstances ,  appears  in  the  parent  —  say ,  once  among  several  million  individuals  —  and  it  reappears  in  the  child ,  the  mere  doctrine  of  chances  almost  compels  us  to  attribute  its  reappearance  to  inheritance .  Every  one  must  have  heard  of  cases  of  albinism ,  prickly  skin ,  hairy  bodies ,  &amp; c . ,  appearing  in  several  members  of  the  same  family .  If  strange  and  rare  deviations  of  structure  are  really  inherited ,  less  strange  and  commoner  deviations  may  be  freely  admitted  to  be  inheritable .  Perhaps  the  correct  way  of  viewing  the  whole  subject  would  be ,  to  look  at  the  inheritance  of  every  character  whatever  as  the  rule ,  and  non - inheritance  as  the  anomaly .

 The  laws  governing  inheritance  are  for  the  most  part  unknown .  No  one  can  say  why  the  same  peculiarity  in  different  individuals  of  the  same  species ,  or  in  different  species ,  is  sometimes  inherited  and  sometimes  not  so ;  why  the  child  often  reverts  in  certain  characteristics  to  its  grandfather  or  grandmother  or  more  remote  ancestor ;  why  a  peculiarity  is  often  transmitted  from  one  sex  to  both  sexes ,  or  to  one  sex  alone ,  more  commonly  but  not  exclusively  to  the  like  sex .  It  is  a  fact  of  some  importance  to  us ,  that  peculiarities  appearing  in  the  males  of  our  domestic  breeds  are  often  transmitted ,  either  exclusively  or  in  a  much  greater  degree ,  to  the  males  alone .  A  much  more  important  rule ,  which  I  think  may  be  trusted ,  is  that ,  at  whatever  period  of  life  a  peculiarity  first  appears ,  it  tends  to  re - appear  in  the  offspring  at  a  corresponding  age ,  though  sometimes  earlier .  In  many  cases  this  could  not  be  otherwise ;  thus  the  inherited  peculiarities  in  the  horns  of  cattle  could  appear  only  in  the  offspring  when  nearly  mature ;  peculiarities  in  the  silk - worm  are  known  to  appear  at  the  corresponding  caterpillar  or  cocoon  stage .  But  hereditary  diseases  and  some  other  facts  make  me  believe  that  the  rule  has  a  wider  extension ,  and  that ,  when  there  is  no  apparent  reason  why  a  peculiarity  should  appear  at  any  particular  age ,  yet  that  it  does  tend  to  appear  in  the  offspring  at  the  same  period  at  which  it  first  appeared  in  the  parent .  I  believe  this  rule  to  be  of  the  highest  importance  in  explaining  the  laws  of  embryology .  These  remarks  are  of  course  confined  to  the  first  appearance  of  the  peculiarity ,  and  not  to  the  primary  cause  which  may  have  acted  on  the  ovules  or  on  the  male  element ;  in  nearly  the  same  manner  as  the  increased  length  of  the  horns  in  the  offspring  from  a  short - horned  cow  by  a  long - horned  bull ,  though  appearing  late  in  life ,  is  clearly  due  to  the  male  element .

 Having  alluded  to  the  subject  of  reversion ,  I  may  here  refer  to  a  statement  often  made  by  naturalists  —  namely ,  that  our  domestic  varieties ,  when  run  wild ,  gradually  but  invariably  revert  in  character  to  their  aboriginal  stocks .  Hence  it  has  been  argued  that  no  deductions  can  be  drawn  from  domestic  races  to  species  in  a  state  of  nature .  I  have  in  vain  endeavoured  to  discover  on  what  decisive  facts  the  above  statement  has  so  often  and  so  boldly  been  made .  There  would  be  great  difficulty  in  proving  its  truth :  we  may  safely  conclude  that  very  many  of  the  most  strongly  marked  domestic  varieties  could  not  possibly  live  in  a  wild  state .  In  many  cases  we  do  not  know  what  the  aboriginal  stock  was ,  and  so  could  not  tell  whether  or  not  nearly  perfect  reversion  had  ensued .  It  would  be  necessary  in  order  to  prevent  the  effects  of  intercrossing ,  that  only  a  single  variety  should  have  been  turned  loose  in  its  new  home .  Nevertheless ,  as  our  varieties  certainly  do  occasionally  revert  in  some  of  their  characters  to  ancestral  forms ,  it  seems  to  me  not  improbable  that  if  we  could  succeed  in  naturalising ,  or  were  to  cultivate ,  during  many  generations ,  the  several  races ,  for  instance ,  of  the  cabbage ,  in  very  poor  soil  ( in  which  case ,  however ,  some  effect  would  have  to  be  attributed  to  the  definite  action  of  the  poor  soil ) ,  that  they  would ,  to  a  large  extent ,  or  even  wholly ,  revert  to  the  wild  aboriginal  stock .  Whether  or  not  the  experiment  would  succeed ,  is  not  of  great  importance  for  our  line  of  argument ;  for  by  the  experiment  itself  the  conditions  of  life  are  changed .  If  it  could  be  shown  that  our  domestic  varieties  manifested  a  strong  tendency  to  reversion ,  —  that  is ,  to  lose  their  acquired  characters ,  whilst  kept  under  the  same  conditions ,  and  whilst  kept  in  a  considerable  body ,  so  that  free  intercrossing  might  check ,  by  blending  together ,  any  slight  deviations  in  their  structure ,  in  such  case ,  I  grant  that  we  could  deduce  nothing  from  domestic  varieties  in  regard  to  species .  But  there  is  not  a  shadow  of  evidence  in  favour  of  this  view :  to  assert  that  we  could  not  breed  our  cart  and  race - horses ,  long  and  short - horned  cattle ,  and  poultry  of  various  breeds ,  and  esculent  vegetables ,  for  an  unlimited  number  of  generations ,  would  be  opposed  to  all  experience .

 But  Mr .  Horner ' s  researches  have  rendered  it  in  some  degree  probable  that  man  sufficiently  civilized  to  have  manufactured  pottery  existed  in  the  valley  of  the  Nile  thirteen  or  fourteen  thousand  years  ago ;  and </td><td>found  more  strictly  and  generally  true  than  seems  to  me  to  be  the  case ,  what  does  it  show ,  but  that  some  of  our  breeds  originated  there ,  four  or  five  thousand  years  ago ?  But  Mr .  Horner ' s  researches  have  rendered  it  in  some  degree  probable  that  man  sufficiently  civilized  to  have  manufactured  pottery  existed  in  the  valley  of  the  Nile  thirteen  or  fourteen  thousand  years  ago ;  and </td><td>found  more  strictly  and  generally  true  than  seems  to  me  to  be  the  case ,  what  does  it  show ,  but  that  some  of  our  breeds  originated  there ,  four  or  five  thousand  years  ago ?  Since  the  recent  discoveries  of  flint  tools  or  celts  in  the  superficial  deposits  of  France  and  England ,  few  geologists  will  doubt  that  man ,  in  a  sufficiently  civilized  state  to  have  manufactured  weapons ,  existed  at  a  period  extremely  remote  as  measured  by  years ;  and  we  know  that  at  the  present  day  there  is  hardly  a  tribe  so  barbarous  as  not  to  have  domesticated  at  least  the  dog .

 The  origin  of  most  of  our  domestic  animals  will  probably  for  ever  remain  vague .  But  I  may  here  state ,  that  looking  to  the  domestic  dogs  of  the  whole  world ,  I  have ,  after  a  laborious  collection  of  all  known  facts ,  come  to  the  conclusion  that  several  wild  species  of  Canid æ  have  been  tamed ,  and  that  their  blood ,  more  or  less  mingled ,  flows  in  the  veins  of  our  many  domestic  breeds .  In  regard  to  sheep  and  goats  I  can  form  no  opinion .  From  facts  communicated  to  me  by  Mr .  Blyth ,  on  the  habits ,  voice ,  and  constitution ,  &amp; c . ,  of  the  humped  Indian  cattle ,  it  is  probable  that  these  descended  from  a  different  aboriginal  stock  from  our  European  cattle ;  and  several  competent  judges  believe  that  these  latter  have  had  more  than  one  wild  parent .  With  respect  to  horses ,  from  reasons  which  I  cannot  here  give ,  I  am  with  much  doubt  inclined  to  believe ,  in  opposition  to  several  authors ,  that  all  the  races  have  descended  from  one  wild  stock .  Mr .  Blyth ,  whose  opinion ,  from  his  large  and  varied  stores  of  knowledge ,  I  should  value  more  than  that  of  almost  any  one ,  thinks  that  all  the  breeds  of  poultry  have  proceeded  from  the  common  wild  Indian  fowl  ( Gallus  bankiva ) .  In  regard  to  ducks  and  rabbits ,  the  breeds  of  which  differ  considerably  from  each  other  in  structure ,  the  evidence  preponderates  in  favour  of  their  having  all  descended  from  the  common  wild  duck  and  rabbit .

 The  doctrine  of  the  origin  of  our  several  domestic  races  from  several  aboriginal  stocks ,  has  been  carried  to  an  absurd  extreme  by  some  authors .  They  believe  that  every  race  which  breeds  true ,  let  the  distinctive  characters  be  ever  so  slight ,  has  had  its  wild  prototype .  At  this  rate  there  must  have  existed  at  least  a  score  of  species  of  wild  cattle ,  as  many  sheep ,  and  several  goats  in  Europe  alone ,  and  several  even  within  Great  Britain .  One  author  believes  that  there  formerly  existed  in  Great  Britain  eleven  wild  species  of  sheep  peculiar  to  it !  When  we  bear  in  mind  that  Britain  has  now  hardly  one  peculiar  mammal ,  and  France  but  few  distinct  from  those  of  Germany  and  conversely ,  and  so  with  Hungary ,  Spain ,  &amp; c . ,  but  that  each  of  these  kingdoms  possesses  several  peculiar  breeds  of  cattle ,  sheep ,  &amp; c . ,  we  must  admit  that  many  domestic  breeds  have  originated  in  Europe ;  for  whence  could  they  have  been  derived ,  as  these  several  countries  do  not  possess  a  number  of  peculiar  species  as  distinct  parent - stocks ?  So  it  is  in  India .  Even  in  the  case  of  the  domestic  dogs  of  the  whole  world ,  which  I  admit  to  have  descended  from  several  wild  species ,  it  cannot  be  doubted  that  there  has  been  an  immense  amount  of  inherited  variation ;  for </td><td>domesticated  at  a  much  earlier  period  than  has  hitherto  been  supposed .  The  lake - inhabitants  of  Switzerland  cultivated  several  kinds  of  wheat  and  barley ,  the  pea ,  the  poppy  for  oil ,  and  flax ;  and  they  possessed  several  domesticated  animals ;  they  had  also  commerce  with  other  nations .  All  this  clearly  shows ,  as  Heer  has  remarked ,  that  they  had  at  this  early  age  progressed  considerably  in  civilization ;  and  this  again  implies  a  long - continued  previous  period  of  less  advanced  civilization ,  during  which  the  domesticated  animals ,  kept  by  the  different  tribes  and  in  different  districts ,  might  have  varied  and  given  rise  to  distinct  races .  Since  the  discovery  of  flint  tools  or  celts  in  the  superficial  formations  of  France  and  England ,  all  geologists  believe  that  man  in  a  barbarous  condition  existed  at  an  enormously  remote  period ;  and  we  know  that  at  the  present  day  there  is  hardly  a  tribe  so  barbarous  as  not  to  have  domesticated  at  least  the  dog .

 The  origin  of  most  of  our  domestic  animals  will  probably  for  ever  remain  vague .  But  I  may  here  state ,  that ,  looking  to  the  domestic  dogs  of  the  whole  world ,  I  have ,  after  a  laborious  collection  of  all  known  facts ,  come  to  the  conclusion  that  several  wild  species  of  Canid æ  have  been  tamed ,  and  that  their  blood ,  more  or  less  mingled  together ,  flows  in  the  veins  of  our  many  domestic  breeds .  In  regard  to  sheep  and  goats  I  can  form  no  opinion .  From  facts  communicated  to  me  by  Mr .  Blyth ,  on  the  habits ,  voice ,  constitution ,  and  structure  of  the  humped  Indian  cattle ,  it  is  probable  that  these  are  descended  from  a  different  aboriginal  stock  from  our  European  cattle ;  and  some  competent  judges  believe  that  these  latter  have  had  several  wild  parents ,  —  whether  or  not  these  deserve  to  be  called  species  or  races .  This  conclusion ,  as  well  as  the  specific  distinction  between  the  humped  and  common  cattle ,  may  indeed  be  looked  at  as  almost  established  by  the  recent  admirable  researches  of  Professor  R ü timeyer .  With  respect  to  horses ,  from  reasons  which  I  cannot  here  give ,  I  am  with  much  doubt  inclined  to  believe ,  in  opposition  to  several  authors ,  that  all  the  races  have  descended  from  one  wild  stock .  Mr .  Blyth ,  whose  opinion ,  from  his  large  and  varied  stores  of  knowledge ,  I  should  value  more  than  that  of  almost  any  one ,  thinks  that  all  the  breeds  of  poultry  have  proceeded  from  the  common  wild  Indian  fowl  ( Gallus  bankiva ) :  having  kept  nearly  all  the  English  kinds  alive ,  having  bred  and  crossed  them ,  and  examined  their  skeletons ,  I  have  come  to  a  similar  conclusion ,  —  the  grounds  of  which  will  be  given  in  a  future  work .  In  regard  to  ducks  and  rabbits ,  the  breeds  of  which  differ  considerably  from  each  other  in  structure ,  the  evidence  strongly  preponderates  in  favour  of  their  having  all  descended  from  the  common  wild  duck  and  rabbit .

 The  doctrine  of  the  origin  of  our  several  domestic  races  from  several  aboriginal  stocks ,  has  been  carried  to  an  absurd  extreme  by  some  authors .  They  believe  that  every  race  which  breeds  true ,  let  the  distinctive  characters  be  ever  so  slight ,  has  had  its  wild  prototype .  At  this  rate  there  must  have  existed  at  least  a  score  of  species  of  wild  cattle ,  as  many  sheep ,  and  several  goats  in  Europe  alone ,  and  several  even  within  Great  Britain .  One  author  believes  that  there  formerly  existed  in  Great  Britain  eleven  wild  species  of  sheep  peculiar  to  it !  When  we  bear  in  mind  that  Britain  has  now  hardly  one  peculiar  mammal ,  and  France  but  few  distinct  from  those  of  Germany ,  and  conversely ,  and  so  with  Hungary ,  Spain ,  &amp; c . ,  but  that  each  of  these  kingdoms  possesses  several  peculiar  breeds  of  cattle ,  sheep ,  &amp; c . ,  we  must  admit  that  many  domestic  breeds  have  originated  in  Europe ;  for  whence  could  they  have  been  derived ,  as  these  several  countries  do  not  possess  a  number  of  peculiar  species  as  distinct  parent - stocks ?  So  it  is  in  India .  Even  in  the  case  of  the  domestic  dogs  of  the  whole  world ,  which  I  admit  to  have  descended  from  several  wild  species ,  it  cannot  be  doubted  that  there  has  been  an  immense  amount  of  inherited  variation ;  for </td><td>domesticated  at  a  much  earlier  period  than  has  hitherto  been  supposed .  The  lake - inhabitants  of  Switzerland  cultivated  several  kinds  of  wheat  and  barley ,  the  pea ,  the  poppy  for  oil ,  and  flax ;  and  they  possessed  several  domesticated  animals ;  they  had  also  commerce  with  other  nations .  All  this  clearly  shows ,  as  Heer  has  remarked ,  that  they  had  at  this  early  age  progressed  considerably  in  civilization ;  and  this  again  implies  a  long - continued  previous  period  of  less  advanced  civilization ,  during  which  the  domesticated  animals ,  kept  by  the  different  tribes  in  different  districts ,  might  have  varied  and  given  rise  to  distinct  races .  Since  the  discovery  of  flint  tools  or  celts  in  the  superficial  formations  in  many  parts  of  the  world ,  all  geologists  believe  that  barbarian  man  existed  at  an  enormously  remote  period ;  and  we  know  that  at  the  present  day  there  is  hardly  a  tribe  so  barbarous  as  not  to  have  domesticated  at  least  the  dog .

This  conclusion ,  as  well  as  the  specific  distinction  between  the  humped  and  common  cattle ,  may ,  indeed ,  be  looked  at  as  established  by  the  recent  admirable  researches  of  Professor  R ü timeyer .

Having  kept  nearly  all  the  English  breeds  of  the  fowl  alive ,  having  bred  and  crossed  them ,  and  examined  their  skeletons ,  it  appears  to  me  almost  certain  that  all  are  the  descendants  of  the  wild  Indian  fowl ,  Gallus  bankiva ;  and  this  is  the  conclusion  of  Mr .  Blyth ,  and  of  others  who  have  studied  this  bird  in  India .  In  regard  to  ducks  and  rabbits ,  some  breeds  of  which  differ  much  from  each  other ,  the  evidence  is  clear  that  they  are  all  descended  from  the  common  wild  duck  and  rabbit .

 Some  authors  have  maintained  that  the  amount  of  variation  in  our  domestic  productions  is  soon  reached ,  and  can  never  afterwards  be  exceeded .  It  would  be  somewhat  rash  to  assert  that  the  limit  has  been  attained  in  any  one  case ;  for  almost  all  our  animals  and  plants  have  been  greatly  improved  in  many  ways  within  a  recent  period ;  and  this  implies  variation .  It  would  be  equally  rash  to  assert  that  characters  now  increased  to  their  utmost  limit ,  could  not ,  after  remaining  fixed  for  many  centuries ,  again  vary  under  new  conditions  of  life .  No  doubt ,  as  Mr .  Wallace  has  remarked  with  much  truth ,  a  limit  will  be  at  last  reached .  For  instance  there  must  be  a  limit  to  the  fleetness  of  any  terrestrial  animal ,  as  this  will  be  determined  by  the  friction  to  be  overcome ,  the  weight  of  body  to  be  carried ,  and  the  power  of  contraction  in  the  muscular  fibres .  But  what  concerns  us  is  that  the  domestic  varieties  of  the  same  species  differ  from  each  other  in  almost  every  character ,  which  man  has  attended  to  and  selected ,  more  than  do  the  distinct  species  of  the  same  genera .  Isidore  Geoffroy  St .  Hilaire  has  proved  this  in  regard  to  size ,  and  so  it  is  with  colour  and  probably  with  the  length  of  hair .  With  respect  to  fleetness ,  which  depends  on  many  bodily  characteristics ,  Eclipse  was  far  fleeter ,  and  a  dray - horse  is  incomparably  stronger  than  any  two  equine  species .  So  with  plants ,  the  seeds  of  the  different  varieties  of  the  bean  or  maize  differ  more  in  size ,  than  do  the  seeds  of  the  distinct  species  in  any  one  genus  of  the  same  two  families .  The  same  remark  holds  good  in  regard  to  the  fruit  of  the  several  varieties  of  the  plum ,  and  still  more  so  with  the  melon ,  as  well  as  in  endless  other  analogous  cases</td><td>,  under  the  conditions  to  which  it  is  exposed  when  domesticated ,  seems  to  have  a  singularly  inflexible  organisation ,  though  it  has  varied  to  a  slight  extent ,  as  I  have  elsewhere  described .
