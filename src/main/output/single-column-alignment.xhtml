gradually but certainly revert in character to their aboriginal stocks . hence it has been argued that no deductions can be drawn from domestic races to species in a state of nature . i have in vain endeavoured to discover on what decisive facts the above statement has so often and so boldly been made . there would be great difficulty in proving its truth : we may safely conclude that very many of the most strongly - marked domestic varieties could not possibly live in a wild state . in many cases we do not know what the aboriginal stock was , and so could not tell whether or not nearly perfect reversion had ensued . it would be quite necessary , in order to prevent the effects of intercrossing , that only a single variety should be turned loose in its new home . nevertheless , as our varieties certainly do occasionally revert in some of their characters to ancestral forms , it seems to me not improbable , that if we could succeed in naturalising , or were to cultivate , during many generations , the several races , for instance , of the cabbage , in very poor soil ( in which case , however , some effect would have to be attributed to the direct action of the poor soil ) , that they would to a large extent , or even wholly , revert to the wild aboriginal stock . whether or not the experiment would succeed , is not of great importance for our line of argument ; for by the experiment itself the conditions of life are changed . if it could be shown that our domestic varieties manifested a strong tendency to reversion , — that is , to lose their acquired characters ,

, after a laborious collection of all known facts , come to the conclusion that several wild species of canid æ have been tamed , and that their blood , in some cases mingled together , flows in the

humped indian cattle , it is almost certain that they are descended from a different aboriginal stock from our european cattle ; and some competent judges believe that these latter have had two or
